This is a web page that will host all my travels. I plan to build it out more as I learn to code.

I know that the hardest things for me to learn are yet to come, rather, the concepts that will take the longest for me to grasp.

With that said I plan to add cool new features to this page all the time. Features that showcase my travels, life events, and anything that seems relevant.

I guess in a way this will be a place that will be ever growing. A place to track personal growth, accomplishments and well my coding skill-z.

If you find this repo then please feel free to email me any ideas or thoughts on how to optimize this page.
