                When I reflext on movement I think of many things. The first images that present themselfs to me
                come in
                the vividness of rockclimbing.
                I am relativly new to the sport but in the short time I have been leaning to climb, it has taken
                over
                many aspects of my life. Climbing has given me confadence,
                and strangth. Its opened new doors of orertunity and even sparked adventure within me again.
                Adventure I
                have not seen in many years.

                This is Spoke, she came to us from a small shelter in norther Colorado. As a puppy Spoke was timid,
                shy,
                scared of everthing but now after a year of growth she is full of life and love.
                Spoke is a renagade when shes in a playfull mood and a jelly ball when she is tired. She draws
                insperation from the morning and makes for a great alarm clock.
                I was unsure how living with a dog in a small van with another person would go, but its been great.
                Thought we have had our ups and downs, having this rambunchis fure ball has been a blessing. Spoke
                is
                indapendent, smart and
                loves her own space. This of course means that we can leave her in the van alone,with plenty of
                water
                and ideal conditions, it is her home after all , and
                she wont bark,wine, or fuss at all. This also means that she has additude and acts like a drama
                queen
                when she is comfertable on the bed.
                So much so that she will give a huff of a bark, jult up and move herself if disturebed.<br>
                The photo that starts
                this collom was taken at the Mallino Canyon pull out just past mile marker 4 on the right of the
                rode as
                you assend up My. Lemmon in Tucson, AZ. The jurney up this canyon is breath taking. as you approch
                you
                are greated with Giant Sagoia pebbaling the left and right shoulders, a large sky that seems ever
                vast
                and blue, and striped granit stone on the herizone. Soon you
                are in gulfed in the rocky spires, cactus and open skys. Winding your way up into the belly of the
                canyon. Black top strething for miles, you could drive for ever in these hills. A certan peace
                resides
                here, a beauty somehow untouched.
